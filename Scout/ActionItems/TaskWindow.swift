/// The views lay every row out eagerly — a `LazyVStack` here wedges the main
/// thread (#83), so the stacks are plain `VStack`s — which makes first paint
/// linear in the number of rows, and slightly worse than linear in practice.
/// That was tolerable at ~150 open rows. The engine never retires an open item,
/// so a real day reached 944 of them by 2026-10-04 and building them all took
/// ~18 s of main-thread layout: opening the tab froze the app. Measured with
/// `PerfHarnessTests`: ~5–12 ms per collapsed card, ~17–30 ms per expanded one.
///
/// A window caps what is built to a page per list, with a "Show more" control
/// for the rest, so the cost of opening the tab no longer grows with the
/// backlog. Search still runs over every task, not just the shown ones.
